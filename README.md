# Pocket-Nutritionist

Continuation of New Hacks 2020 nutrition app project.
  - data is now coming from the USDA food central api.
  - New nutrient list will contain 18 minerals and micronutrients
  
There are a lot of apps on the internet that help users calculate their macronutrient and energy intake. (protein, carbohydrates, fat, calories.) However, in order to have a healthy and balanced diet, it is necessary for your diet to also have a balanced micronutrient and minerals profile (A, B vitamins, potassium, calcium, iron, manganese, etc.) 

The goal of this project is to create a simple to use web app that helps users summarize their micronutrient and mineral intake in order to alert them of possible deficiencies. Balancing your micronutrient and mineral profile is not a difficult idea to understand, but streamlining the process may make it easier and more attractive for people to perform such an analysis on their diet.

The data for this project comes from the food API maintained by USDA.
